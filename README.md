# Pytorch-Tutorial
I had a lot of questions as I went through the Deep Learning Blitz tutorial from pytorch.org, so I made my own tutorial trying to answer them (and get practice with pytorch).

Note: viewing on website makes navigation possible (i.e. clicking the next hyperlink scrolls you down to the next section). That stuff doesn't work when you view the notebook itself in this repository. :(
