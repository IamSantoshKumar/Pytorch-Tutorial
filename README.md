# Pytorch-Tutorial:

I had a lot of questions as I went through the Deep Learning Blitz tutorial from pytorch.org, so I made my own tutorial trying to answer them (and get practice with pytorch).

Note 1: viewing on website makes navigation possible (i.e. clicking the next hyperlink scrolls you down to the next section). That stuff doesn't work when you view the notebook itself in this repository. :(

Note 2: This was all done around late December to January (PyTorch 3.0). I don't see why it wouldn't be backwards compatible with later versions of PyTorch, but in case you have a later version (PyTorch >3.0) and something doesn't work - that's probably why.

# Running the notebooks on your home machine:

Clone the repository:

> https://github.com/joshualmitchell/Pytorch-Tutorial.git

Navigate to the directory (in the command line or terminal):

> cd Pytorch-Tutorial

Run Jupyter Notebook (assuming you have it installed with pip, anaconda, etc):

> jupyter notebook pytorchtut.ipynb

Enjoy!
